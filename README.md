# LightsOn

Arduino controlled lighting inside model buildings to vary color and brightness to simulate movement inside the rooms.

Models of buildings are enhanced if they have interiors with lights. Real buildings have occupants who move around switching some lights on or off and by moving they cause shadows and variations in the light. Also, different types of light have different colors.

This project tries to simulate that variation in lighting by using programmable LEDs and an Arduino.

The hardware & software have been installed and working in model buildings since 2021.

The next step is to add a control panel & LCD display such that the variables within the software can be altered without having to upload new software.
