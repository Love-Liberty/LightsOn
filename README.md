# LightsOn

**The User-Editing-of-lights-&-manual-override** 

part of the project uses the commands supplied by the User-input-output branch to edit the stored data that determines how the lights are illuminated.

The automatic system has data hard coded on how those lights behave. The user IO and the user Editing aims to edit that data to change the way the system then displays the lights.

The automatic system was completed months ago and has been installed as hardware. 
The user IO section is more or less complete, but latest version not yet on github
The editing section is partially complete although not yet uploaded to github

The current challenge is merging the two user files.


**Arduino controlled lighting inside model buildings to vary color and brightness to simulate movement inside the rooms.**

Models of buildings are enhanced if they have interiors with lights. Real buildings have occupants who move around switching some lights on or off and by moving they cause shadows and variations in the light. Also, different types of light have different colors.

This project tries to simulate that variation in lighting by using programmable LEDs and an Arduino.

The hardware & software have been installed and working in model buildings since 2021.

The next step is to add a control panel & LCD display such that the variables within the software can be altered without having to upload new software.

The layout and a simulation can be seen at Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aeadTduApG7-introduction. (If you look, you have to slide the switch to the ON position.

In the existing Oct 2022 software the slide switch has been replaced with a photoresistor input that turns the lights on or off depending on the room lighting.

The LCD display & menu can be seen in early stage https://wokwi.com/projects/349613619705545298 Nov 29 2022
